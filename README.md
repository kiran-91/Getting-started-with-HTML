# Simple HTML UI Project
## My first HTML project 

Welcome to the Simple HTML UI Project! This project consists of a basic user interface built using HTML. It includes multiple pages that demonstrate the use of various HTML elements and structures.

# What is HTML?
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the basic language used to create web pages. It uses special codes called "tags" to tell a web browser how to display text, images, links, and other content on a webpage. Think of HTML as the building blocks of a website, helping to organize and structure the information so that it looks good and is easy to navigate.
